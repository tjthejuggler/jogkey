a way to make fade
a way to make strobe?

a way to manually edit markers with numbers
	this can currently be done in files, but would be better in a popup text edit

put text boxes next to virtual balls for real ball chanels

real life ball playback

user can create "paints" which are solid colors, strobes, or fades
	strobe is essentially a fade, just with a very quick transition

figure out if using built in secuence is necessary or if should just use my own
