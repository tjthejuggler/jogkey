a way to make fade
	a button that is 'this gap is to be a fade' that get pressed in between two colors
	or
	a toggleable option with 1,q,a,z that is 'fade mode' for each of them
	a possibly different fade is one where you start holding control, and until you press another key,
		that is how long the fade goes on for

a way to strobe
	instead of a color wheel, have a mini one track window pop up that can be done and "saved to a key"


a way to manually edit markers with numbers
	this can currently be done in files, but would be better in a popup text edit
	open a big editable text with the whole marker in it

user can create "paints" which are solid colors, strobes, or fades
	strobe is essentially a fade, just with a very quick transition

figure out if using built in secuence is necessary or if should just use my own
