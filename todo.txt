get rid of D thing in main.py where MBox is called

make special coding that user sees, where entire fades are just called fades, and maybe color names are commented

copy MBox call as editbox for when its clicked

refactor main, and others

make song selection choosable

a way to strobe
	instead of a color wheel, have a mini one track window pop up that can be done and "saved to a key"
	even fade should exist in here
	there should be a definable time length in here and it should wrap to strobe

user can create "paints" which are solid colors, strobes, or fades
	strobe is essentially a fade, just with a very quick transition

figure out if using built in secuence is necessary or if should just use my own
