get rid of D thing in main.py where MBox is called

copy MBox call as editbox for when its clicked

open texteditbox when circle or a button on the cirle is clicked

refactor main, and others

make song selection choosable

a way to strobe
	instead of a color wheel, have a mini one track window pop up that can be done and "saved to a key"
	even fade should exist in here
	there should be a definable time length in here and it should wrap to strobe

a way to manually edit markers with numbers
	this can currently be done in files, but would be better in a popup text edit
	open a big editable text with the whole marker in it

user can create "paints" which are solid colors, strobes, or fades
	strobe is essentially a fade, just with a very quick transition

figure out if using built in secuence is necessary or if should just use my own
